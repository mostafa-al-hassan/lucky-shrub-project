                <p>
                    Often referred to as "Dumb Cane," Dieffenbachia is popular for its tropical, lush leaves patterned with variegated tones of green and white. The easy-care houseplant thrives in indirect light, but can tolerate low light (the leaves may not grow as large).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Water: Every one to two weeks, or when the top inch or two of soil feels dry</li>
                    <li>Sunlight: Bright, indirect light, but can tolerate low light</li>
                    <li>Note: The sap can be toxic to pets and children if ingested</li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    Native to Mexico and Central America, Monstera Deliciosa requires minimal care. The heart-shaped leaves — often with holes — can grow as large as 35 inches long and 25 inches wide. The exotic houseplant requires moderate watering and indirect light (bright to medium is best).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Water: Every one to two weeks</li>
                    <li>Sunlight: Bright to medium indirect sunlight</li>
                    <li>Take note: This plant is toxic to cats and dogs.</li>
                    
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                  <h1><img src="Lucky-Shrub-logos\Plants\Peperomia.png" alt="plant3"></h1>
                <p>
                    These colorful plants grow great indoors. They hold water in their stems and leaves, making them drought tolerant. When watering, make sure not to over water and check to see if the soil is completely dry in between watering sessions.
